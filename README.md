# dnstressor

This is a Python3 script to stress test your DNS server with DNS queries for A records of random hostnames.
The script doesn't take any arguments and simply uses you OS configured DNS server as the target (as per /etc/resolv.conf for example).
Please be sensible and only use it on authorized target servers.
